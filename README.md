## Description of the problem

<p align="justify">
A great number of fruits are grown around the world, each of which has various types. The factors that determine the type of fruit are the external appearance features such as color, length, diameter, and shape. The external appearance of the fruits is a major determinant of the fruit type. Determining the variety of fruits by looking at their external appearance may necessitate expertise, which is time-consuming and requires great effort. The aim of this project is to classify the types of date fruit, that are Barhee, Deglet Nour, Sukkary, Rotab Mozafati, Ruthana, Safawi, and Sagaiz by using a deep neural network.

<p align="justify">
In accordance with this purpose, 898 images of seven different date fruit types were obtained via the computer vision system (CVS). Through image processing techniques, a total of 34 features, including morphological features, shape, and color, were extracted from these images.
