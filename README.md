## Structure of the repository

The repository conatins the next files and folderrs:

- `images`: folder with images to README.md

## Description of the problem

<p align="justify">
A great number of fruits are grown around the world, each of which has various types. The factors that determine the type of fruit are the external appearance features such as color, length, diameter, and shape. The external appearance of the fruits is a major determinant of the fruit type. Determining the variety of fruits by looking at their external appearance may necessitate expertise, which is time-consuming and requires great effort. 
</p>

## Objective

<p align="justify">
The aim of this project is to classify the types of date fruit<b>, that are Barhee, Deglet Nour, Sukkary, Rotab Mozafati, Ruthana, Safawi, and Sagaiz</b> by using <b>a deep neural network model</b>.
</p>

## Data description

<b>Data set source:</b>
> https://www.muratkoklu.com/datasets/

<p align="justify">
In accordance with this purpose, 898 images of seven different date fruit types were obtained via the computer vision system (CVS). Through image processing techniques, a total of 34 features, including morphological features, shape, and color, were extracted from these images.

## Setting up the virtual environment

<p align="justify">
A virtual environment allows us to manage libraries or dependencies for different projects without having the version compatibility problem by creating isolated virtual environments for them. There are many environments managment systems for python such as conda, pipenv, venv, virtualenv and so on, but for this project I used pipenv. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Next, I'll explain how to install pipenv, and create an environment for a python project.
Before staring , first we need to install pip, which is a package-management system to install python packages, run these codes in the console.
</p>

> For windows:

    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

    python get-pip.py
  
> For linux:

    sudo apt update

    sudo apt install python3-pip
  
Then after installing pip, we need to install pipenv
    
    pip install pipenv

Once here, it is necessary to clon this repository from Github

    cd ./file_name
    
    git clone 

create a folder and activate the virtual environment
  
    mkdir ./name_folder
